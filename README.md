Data from the 2019 Clubs &amp; Governance Survey

Sample Size

Contrary to what many believe, the relative size of the sample to the population under examination (in this case, all students of Trinity College) does not matter. So long as respondents are randomly selected from the population, their responses will increasingly represent the distribution of responses in the population. As the responses in our sample had a lot of variation, we had no reason to believe they were not representative of the rest of the student body. Thus, in this study, the sample of 90 is actually very good. The only drawback is that small samples have less statistical power, meaning it is harder to detect small effects (e.g. in this study, social year might have had a small effect on engagement, but it was not found to be statistically significant). Future studies should seek to achieve greater statistical power by increasing the sample size.

Normality

The two dependent variables under examination (TCM attendance and general engagement) were not normally distributed. Fortunately, the t-tests and analysis of variance that were used are robust tests that can handle non-normal data (although this also decreases our power to detect small effect sizes), so the hit to statistical power was accepted and the non-normal scores were used. However, the raw scores for TCM attendance were very positively skewed (as a disproportionate number of respondents had not attended any TCMs), so 1 was added to each score and the log was taken to reduce skewness.

Statistical Significance

An alpha level of .05 was used for all of tests conducted in this analysis. When results are found to be significant at this level, it means that there is only a 5% chance of getting that result if there isn’t an effect of the variable we are examining. In other words, it is very unlikely that such data would be found if the variable we are examining didn’t have an effect.
 
Defining Ethnicity

For the purposes of this study, ethnicity was grouped by the racial categories used in the American Census (i.e. White, Asian, Mixed Race, Indigenous, Black, and Hispanic). There is not objectively correct level at which to measure ethnicity, so the broadest possible categories were used to obtain large enough sample sizes to be useful. All responses that indicated a subset of the above categories (e.g. South-West European, North-East Asian, Indian, etc.) were all adjusted to fit one of the larger categories, as this level of specificity makes any analysis useless. Even with the broader categories used, there were not enough people in the Indigenous, Black, and Hispanic categories to perform any useful analysis of their involvement in Trinity. For this reason, all of the non-white ethnicities were grouped together and compared to the scores of those in the White category. This appeared to yield useful results, which are shown on page 13 of the slide deck.

Open Data

Research is improved when the methods are transparent and the data is publicly available. For this reason, all of the analysis and original data used in this report have been published online for the curious to explore and conduct their own analysis. As is common practice when dealing with microdata, all identifying information has been removed from the responses and the rows of the dataset have been randomized. Further, all demographic information that was not found to have a significant effect (i.e. social year, field of study, international status, and gender) has been removed.
